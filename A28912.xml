            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

theſe men which was maliciouſly proſecuted againſt by thee, though they had broken no known Law in this Nation as far as I can ſee, in as much as the ſupreme power and Magiſtracy hath releaſed the oppreſſed, it is to their honour, and in it they are a terrour to evill doers, and a praiſe to them that doe well, and theſe men who are releaſed may give God the glory, who alone is worthy for evermore.</p>
            <p>Towards the latter end of their book it ſeems there was ſome Queries propounded to Prieſt <hi>Smith</hi> or any of the Prieſts in <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> to be anſwered which he puts off himſelf ſaying, I thank you; that you call upon them as well as my ſelf to anſwer?<note place="margin">
                  <p>Had it not been more wiſdome for him to have anſwered the queries, then to have ſpent his time in accuſing men falſly.</p>
                  <p>1 Pet. 3.15. Calling ſuch as formerly had been his hearers a Cage of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Birds or neſt of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, yea them which he formerly looked upon as a Church to God, which if he did ſo, it may be his iudgement was not right then, neither right now, it may be he cried peace, while they put into his mouth, but now prepares war againſt them, though it may be they are as upright in their hearts unto the Lord as ever they were when he looked upon them, to be a Church to God.</p>
               </note> But to be brief we have received no anſwer to them, neither from them nor him, but it is the moſt to his ſhame, who begins a piece of work and doth not finiſh it, it may be there is ſome people that deſires ſatisfaction concerning the things which was propounded, ſeeing they are matters of weight and great concernment; but it is like <hi>Smith</hi> doth not matter for that: for if they contradict him in what he ſaith, or aske him a queſtion, or come into his Congregation, though it may be they ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it is poſſible he may ſay, they aſtoniſh or diſturb the Congregation, witneſs his own book <hi>page</hi> 4, and 6, and the means he will uſe to recover, ſuch is <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> Gaol or <hi>Bedlam:</hi> but in that he calls his concluſion, he ſaith, I have done with them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that now it is like we may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

an anſwer from him to theſe Queries: unleſs he make himſelf a publick lyer, which if he ſhould doe ſo, his anſwers would give but little ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the people, if they know they come from the mouth of a lyer, ſo that now if theſe Queries they propounded be anſwered at all, it is like it muſt be by ſome other, which may be will anſwer more wiſely than <hi>Smith</hi> hath done in examining this book of theirs, which he called ſcandalous, which was eaſy for him to ſay: but not ſo eaſy to prove.</p>
            <p>And now theſe men are cleared of the things he accuſed them with, and alſo them which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his book, have denyed the things which is contrary to the truth, and the truth of God is clear, and the filth he would have caſt upon theſe men who publiſhed the book he examines, is upon his own head returned, though much more might be ſaid in vindication of the truth, and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of theſe men in the things which he accuſes them with, and againſt his practiſe but at preſent, I ſhall ſay but a little more, for if he be not paſt ſhame, this might ſuffice to make him ceaſe boaſting in his folly, which if it doe not, more may be ſaid another time, at preſent I deſire all people to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in the fear of the Lord God, how they ſtand and whom they uphold and beleeve, leaſt belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch as <hi>Smith,</hi> they be incenſed againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and receive a prejudice in their minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the people which the Lord hath bleſſed, that ſo they cannot beleeve the truth of the Lord God, which he in this his day of love hath made known, to the gathering of his people together from the Shepheards that doe feed themſelves,<note place="margin">Ezek. 34.2, 3, 4, 13, 14, 15.</note> and feed not the flock, but eate the fat, cloath with the wool,
